##  Synopsis: 
#### This is a project following up on the <a href="https://comptroller.nyc.gov/reports/discomfort-stations-the-conditions-and-availability-of-nyc-parks-bathrooms/"> comptroller's report </a>in 2019 about the state of public bathrooms and the Urban Design Forum's <a href="https://urbandesignforum.org/the-need-for-public-bathrooms-in-new-york-city/"> report </a> in 2020 about the need for public bathrooms. 

## Context: 
#### In 2019, the comptroller released a report annalyzing park bathroom grades and their abysmmal state. This is a check-up project. Has the state of public bathrooms gotten any better in the last 4 years, in 2023? 

## Methodology:
